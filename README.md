HR Analysis Power BI Dashboard

This project aims to build a Human Resources (HR) analysis Power BI dashboard, providing valuable insights to enhance our understanding of the employment situation. The dashboard will consist of two main components:

1. The Overview Dashboard: This section includes an overview of key metrics such as gender, citizenship, marital status, and race. It offers a high-level snapshot of demographic distributions within the workforce.
